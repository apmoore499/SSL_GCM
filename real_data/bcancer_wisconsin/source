Features describe characteristics of cell nuclei present in cellular images of a potentially cancerous mass. These features relate to the geometry of the shape, and are given as continuous values. 

10 features are investigated:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Area of mass}
\item{Compactness, perimeter$^{2}/area -1$}
\item{Concavity of mass}
\item{Fractal dimension, "coastline approximation" -1}
\item{Item radius, mean of distance from center to perimeter}
\item{Number of concave portions of the perimeter}
\item{Perimeter of mass}
\item{Smoothness, local variation in radius lengths}
\item{Symmetry}
\item{Texture via standard deviation of gray-scale intensities}



Each feature is given as the mean, standard error and worst-case value, resulting in 30 features in total.
