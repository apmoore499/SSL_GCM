what else needs to be done



- plot the synthetic datasets []
		- gumbel []	
		- disjoint []


- pick n workers for optimal performance: [x] 4 seems to work best

n_workers=8, time taken: 1.8985329866409302 minutes
n_workers=4, time taken: 1.4894595225652059 minutes [x] <- this one is the best
n_workers=16, too slow aborted
n_workers=2, time taken: 1.7493440588315328 minutes
n_workers=1, too slow aborted
n_workers=0, too slow aborted




so if we can get 1.48 minute for every run, that is 148 minutes which is less than 3 hours. for 1 dataset. over all datasets. slow. but the outcome seems to be variable. 



it seems that using:

torch.set_float32_matmul_precision('medium') 

doesn't change accuracy. is slightly higher for 'medium' setting than none. gumbel method with 'medium' is more accurate compared to psup baseline.
